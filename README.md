## 1. About the Project

Our project, BBY-10, is developing an AI-powered fitness app to help individuals who struggle with planning or
maintaining proper form during their fitness journey. Our solution offers personalised workout plans, goal setting, and
progress tracking through a user-friendly calendar interface. Additionally, users can monitor their form in real-time by
integrating AI technology and the MoveNet API.
